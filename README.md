# Using single-visit into integrated occupancy models to make the best of existing monitoring programs: R codes and data

This repository contains all codes and data to run the occupancy models present in our [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/848663v1.abstract). Please contact me if something goes wrong with the code, or for any question.

## Bottlenose dolphins: JAGS code and data  

Find attached data and codes to run occupancy analyses with the bottlenose dolphins case study. Please, contact me if any trouble.  

##### Repeated-visits (RV) occupancy models

  - Aerial surveys RV occupancy model
  - At-sea surveys RV occupancy model
  - Integrated RV occupancy model 
  
##### Single-visit (SV) occupancy models

  - Aerial surveys SV occupancy model
  - At-sea surveys SV occupancy model
  - Integrated SV occupancy model
  
##### Integrated occupancy model mixing single- and repeated-visits
