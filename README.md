# Using single-visit into integrated occupancy models to make the most of existing monitoring programs: R codes and data

This repository contains all codes and data to run the occupancy models present in our [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/848663v1.abstract). Please contact me if something goes wrong with the code, or for any question.

## Data exploration and initiation to occupancy models

In [this file](DataExplo.pdf), we described the context of bottlenose dolphin _(Tursiops truncatus)_ monitoring in the French Mediterranean Sea. We provided a regional map of the study area, and a map of the monitoring programs used in this analyze. 

In [this file](Worked_example.pdf), we first list the assumptions required for single-visit, repeated-visits, and integrated occupancy models explicitly trying to make comparison between the methods clear. Then, we provided a worked example of the likelihood functions single-visit, repeated-visits, and integrated occupancy models for the same hypothetical data for one site. We hope to clarify the differences in the methods, as to how the information is used. 

## Simulations

## Bottlenose dolphins: JAGS code and data  

Find attached [data and codes](dolphins_codes/) to run occupancy analyses with the bottlenose dolphins case study. Please, contact me if any trouble.
