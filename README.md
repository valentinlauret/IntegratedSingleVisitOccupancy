# Using single-visit into integrated occupancy models to make the most of existing monitoring programs: R codes and data

This repository contains all codes and data to run the occupancy models present in our [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/848663v1.abstract). Please contact me if something goes wrong with the code, or for any question.
